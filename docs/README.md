# LinkMart

Two dev branches (You may create as many sub-branches as you want)
- frontend
- backend

Initial setup:
```bash
# if you don't already have a local branch
git checkout -b {branch_name}
# set remote upstream to push/pull from branch
# right now remote has 2 branches for dev: frontend/backend
git pull -u origin {branch_name}
```
Commit very often, push often

Happy coding ðŸ¥°
